# Welcome to my challenge of << 100_days_of_code >>

## This repository consists of:
- Successfully lead and publicly commit to programming for at least 1 hour a day for 100 consecutive days.
- The ultimate goal is to create a programming habit, to learn to code, or improve my skill level with a  technology or programming language, which in my case is JavaScript.

### The main rules are two:
1. Code at least one hour every day for the next 100 days, with the possibility of failure one time in 15 days
2. Tweet my progress every day with the hashtag #100DaysOfCode.

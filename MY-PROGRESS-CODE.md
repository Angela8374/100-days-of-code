# Welcome to my challenge of
<p alinear = "centro">#100_days_of_code </p>

## This repository consists of:
- Successfully lead and publicly commit to programming for at least 1 hour a day for 100 consecutive days.
- The ultimate goal is to create a programming habit, to learn to code, or improve my skill level with a  technology or programming language, which in my case is JavaScript.

### The main rules are two:
1. Code at least one hour every day for the next 100 days, with the possibility of failure in 15 days
2. Tweet my progress every day with the hashtag #100DaysOfCode.
